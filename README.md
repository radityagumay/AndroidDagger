# Android Dagger
Implement Dagger2, RxAndroid, Retrofit, and MVP

Most of you maybe familiar with Depedency Injection. Dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)

In this section i want to share little bit about how to use depedency injection in Android Using Dagger2. I also implement RxAndroid, Retrofit, and MVP Pattern.

The idea of Depedency Injection in used to reduce amount of Classess, Code and, Avoid BoilerPlate, and of course move your singleton pattern into one in Main Application (usually). But here, i am will make it a modular.

Know the architecture of application is good for you. I advice you to learn about SOLID Architecture, before run more further.
